# chronometrist
A time tracker in Emacs with a nice interface

Largely modelled after the Android application, [A Time Tracker](https://github.com/netmackan/ATimeTracker)

* Benefits
  1. Extremely simple and efficient to use
  2. Displays useful information about your time usage
  3. Support for both mouse and keyboard
  4. Human errors in tracking are easily fixed by editing a plain text file
  5. Hooks to let you perform arbitrary actions when starting/stopping tasks

* Limitations
  1. No support (yet) for adding a task without clocking into it.
  2. No support for concurrent tasks.

**IMPORTANT: with version v0.3, chronometrist no longer uses timeclock as a dependency and will use its own s-expression-based backend. A command to migrate the timeclock-file, `chronometrist-migrate-timelog-file->sexp-file`, is provided.**

## Differences from timeclock
* Stores data in an s-expression format rather than a line-based one
* Supports attaching tags and arbitrary key-values to time intervals
* Has commands to shows useful summaries
* Has a more useful implementation of hooks (see [Hooks](#Hooks))

## Differences from Org time tracking
* Chronometrist is tailored towards long-term, rarely-changing, everyday tasks, rather than transient ones. You might think of it as a program to help balance your day, or to help you form habits.

## Installation
You can get `chronometrist` from https://framagit.org/contrapunctus/chronometrist/

`chronometrist` requires [dash.el](https://github.com/magnars/dash.el)

Add the Chronometrist directory to your load-path, and `(require 'chronometrist)`.

## Commands
### chronometrist
Run `M-x chronometrist` to see your projects, the time you spent on them today, which one is active, and the total time clocked today.

Hit `RET` on a project to clock in for it. If it's already clocked in, it will be clocked out, and you'll be prompted for an optional reason. Use `M-RET` if you don't want to be asked for a reason.

Whenever you call `chronometrist`, the cursor will helpfully be placed on the last activity you clocked out of, or the current activity clocked in.

Alternatively, hit `<numeric prefix> RET` anywhere in the buffer to toggle the corresponding project, e.g. `C-1 RET` will toggle the project with index 1.

Press `l` to view your `chronometrist-file` (`~/.emacs.d/chronometrist.sexp` by default). Press `r` to see a weekly report (see `chronometrist-report`)

Running `M-x chronometrist` when the Chronometrist buffer is visible will kill it, so the key you bind it to can function as a toggle.

`chronometrist` keeps itself updated via an idle timer - no need to frequently press `g` to update.

#### Attaching key values to time intervals (experimental)
Add `chronometrist-kv-read` to `chronometrist-before-in-functions` and/or `chronometrist-before-out-functions`, as you like (see [Hooks](#Hooks)).

You will now be prompted to enter key-values when you clock in/out. Leave an entry blank to exit the prompt, edit the resulting key-values by hand if required, then press `C-c C-c` to accept the key-values (or `C-c C-k` to cancel).

### chronometrist-report
Run `M-x chronometrist-report` (or `chronometrist` with a prefix argument of 1, or press `r` in the `chronometrist` buffer) to see a weekly report.

Press `b` to look at past weeks, and `f` for future weeks.

Press `l` to view your `chronometrist-file`, `~/.emacs.d/chronometrist.sexp` by default.

Just like `chronometrist`, `chronometrist-report` will also toggle the visibilty of the buffer.

`chronometrist-report` keeps itself updated via an idle timer - no pressing `g` to update.

### chronometrist-statistics
Run `M-x chronometrist-statistics` (or `chronometrist` with a prefix argument of 2) to view statistics.

Press `b` to look at past time ranges, and `f` for future ones.

Press `l` to view your `chronometrist-file`, `~/.emacs.d/chronometrist.sexp` by default.

Just like `chronometrist`, `chronometrist-statistics` will also toggle the visibilty of the buffer.

## Customization
See the Customize groups `chronometrist` and `chronometrist-report` for variables intended to be user-customizable.

### Hooks
Chronometrist currently has four hooks -
1. `chronometrist-before-in-functions`
2. `chronometrist-after-in-functions`
3. `chronometrist-before-out-functions`
4. `chronometrist-after-out-functions`

As their names suggest, these are 'abnormal' hooks, i.e. the functions they contain must accept arguments. In this case, each function must accept exactly one argument, which is the project which is being started or stopped.

As an example from the author's own init -

```elisp
(defun my-start-guitar (project)
  (when (equal project "Guitar")
    (find-file-other-window "~/repertoire.org")))

(add-hook 'chronometrist-before-in-functions 'my-start-guitar)
```

Another one, prompting the user if they have uncommitted changes in a git repository (assuming they use [Magit](https://magit.vc/)) -

```elisp
(autoload 'magit-anything-modified-p "magit")

(defun my-commit-prompt ()
  (if (magit-anything-modified-p)
      (if (yes-or-no-p "You have uncommitted changes. Really clock out? ")
          t
        (magit-status)
        nil)
        t))

(add-hook 'chronometrist-before-out-functions 'my-commit-prompt)
```

### Adding more information
Since v0.3, Chronometrist supports adding additional information to tracked time, in the form of tags and user-defined key-value pairs.

#### Tags
Tags can be added using the `chronometrist-tags-add` function. It can currently be added to any hooks except `chronometrist-before-in-functions`.

#### Key-value pairs
Key-value pairs can be added using the `chronometrist-kv-add` function. It can currently be added to any hooks except `chronometrist-before-in-functions`. Keys can be any string except "name", "tags", "start", or "end". Values can be any readable Lisp values.

### Prompt when exiting Emacs
If you wish to be prompted when you exit Emacs while tracking time, you can use this -

`(add-hook 'kill-emacs-query-functions 'chronometrist-query-stop)`

## Roadmap/Ideas
* Show details for time spent on a project when clicking on a non-zero "time spent" field (in both Chronometrist and Chronometrist-Report buffers).

### chronometrist
1. Use `make-thread` in v26 or the emacs-async library for `chronometrist-entries`/`chronometrist-report-entries`
2. Some way to update buffers every second without making Emacs unusable. (impossible?)
3. "Day summary" - for users who use the "reason" feature to note the specifics of their actual work. Combine the reasons together to create a descriptive overview of the work done in the day.

### Chronometrist-report
1. Show week counter and max weeks; don't scroll past first/last weeks
2. Highlight column of current day
3. Add support for other locale weeks/weekday names
4. Show only certain projects

### chronometrist-statistics
1. Show range counter and max ranges; don't scroll past first/last time ranges
2. activity-specific - average time spent in $TIMEPERIOD, average days worked on in $TIMEPERIOD, current/longest/last streak, % of $TIMEPERIOD, % of active (tracked) time in $TIMEPERIOD, ...
3. general - most productive $TIMEPERIOD, GitHub-style work heatmap calendar, ...
4. press 1 for weekly stats, 2 for monthly, 3 for yearly

### Miscellaneous
1. README - add images
2. [-] Create test timelog file and UI behaviour tests
3. Use for `chronometrist-report-weekday-number-alist` whatever variables like `initial-frame-alist` use to get that fancy Custom UI for alists.
4. Multi-timelog-file support?
5. [inflatable raptor](https://github.com/MichaelMure/git-bug/#planned-features)
