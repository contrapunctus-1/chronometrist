1. Merge *-format-keybinds into a single function
2. Move time operations into a chronometrist-time file
3. -report - highlight the current day

Chronometrist
1. don't suggest nil when asking for first project on first run
2. use variables instead of hardcoded numbers to determine spacing
3. refactor repetitive calls to (format "%04d-%02d-%02d" (elt seq a) (elt seq b) (elt seq c))
4. when starting a project with time of "-" (i.e. not worked on today until now), immediately set time to 0 instead of waiting for the first timer refresh
5. Mouse commands should work only on buttons.
6. Button actions should accept prefix arguments and behave exactly like their keyboard counterparts.
7. mouse-3 should clock-out without asking for reason.
8. Some way to ask for the reason just before starting a project. Even when clocking out, the reason is asked _before_ clocking out,which adds time to the project.
9. Timeclock already _has_ hooks! :| Why do we re-implement them?
10. Optimization. `chronometrist-refresh' is expensive in CPU, and `chronometrist-timer' runs it every 3 seconds by default. :\
