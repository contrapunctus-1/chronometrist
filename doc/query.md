* a single query function, which returns whatever fields you specify from the events returned by whatever criteria you specify

(&key RETURN CODE DATE TIME PROJECT COMMENT)

RETURN can be
* nil - entire events are returned
* a symbol - `code`, `date`, `time`, `project`, or `comment` - for each event, return only that object.
* a list of these symbols - for each event, return only these objects

CODE ...

DATE can be
* nil - query all dates
* Any date format we accept, including (YEAR MONTH DAY) and calendrical information returned by (decode-time)
* a pair containing one of the above formats - query between these dates. (nil . DATE) means from the beginning to DATE; conversely, (DATE . nil) means from DATE to the end.
* a list containing dates and/or pairs

TIME ...

PROJECT can be
* nil - for all projects
* A string - a single project
* A list of strings - these specific projects

COMMENT ...

(Sounds an awful lot like SQL, doesn't it? 😓)

## Arbitrary key values (custom storage format)
If we end up creating a custom s-exp based format which allows for arbitrary key values apart from the ones listed above (see [doc/tags.md](doc/tags.md)), we'd probably need to go the macro route.

How do we know how to compare a given key's value to the specified value? Should we have the user define them first?

Do we really need to define values and comparators? Or can `equal` do? I'd like to do
* pattern matching on dates e.g. `(2019 _ _)` for all dates in 2019 - but that can be accomplished with `:date (2019 1 1) (2019 12 31)`. A more complex example - `(_ 1 _)` for events from January for all years. Or `(_ _ 1)` for the first date of any month.
* regexp matching for string values

## Data structure
We use a hash table with dates as keys and events as values. But - if we want to make this something other projects can use - other applications may not want to have dates as keys.

One possibility is to use integers as keys.

## Nic Ferrier's [emacs-db](https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-db) and [emacs-kv](https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-kv)
I tried out -db. I wanted to store plists, but it seems to support only alists. Also, it stores them as a the printed representation of a hash table...which is probably faster than `read`ing individual s-exps and assembling that into one, but probably not nice to edit by hand (which is one of our major requirements).
